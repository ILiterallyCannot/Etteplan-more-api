# Etteplan-more-api
API project using VR train service

This project took around 2 weeks of late night coding to complete, and a large portion of it was done with the help of rescourses like facebooks react documentation, stackoverflow, and with the help of classmates and friends.

The app as a whole was not too difficult to make, although I had my fair share of challenges and learning experiences from it, as it took a lot of understanding and practice, and a whole lot of console.log messages to understand what is really happening here.

The only method I was unable to get working as I wanted, was the sorting method. I am sure there is plenty of ways to do it, but time was definitely not on my side for it. Of course, I will continue to learn how everything works, and will likely come up with a better solution soon.

Features include autocomplete station searches, and sorting the table by arriving and departing trains, and then of course the sort function when you click on the time column.

But for someone who has nothing more than a few weeks of classroom lessons and almost 0 knowledge of how react works, I would say this app was a lot of fun to make.

App found here: https://codepen.io/I_Literally_can_not/pen/JVopaQ,

and here: https://student.labranet.jamk.fi/~L8314/reactapp/

and of course here in codepen. There are two versons of the app, one built using a standard html and js file, where one can see the entire code, and another built using node.js and npm. These hide the actual react files from the public where they are not visible. All versions (github, labranet, codepen) are exactly the same and fully working as I finished it. Enjoy!
